Hi! I'm Samuel, a third-year studying **Computer Science** at Cornell University 
with a minor in **Artificial Intelligence**. Currently, my interests lie in software
engineering, web development, and robotics. 

In my free time, I'm always looking for someone to play 18 holes of golf with. I
also love to travel and talk about my faith. Feel free to reach out anytime for 
a chat!
